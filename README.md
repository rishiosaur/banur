## Getting Started

Before doing anything, make sure you read through the specification documentation to truly understand how the different server pieces fit together.

### Spinning up an instance

You can start up a server by using the Banur CLI (also packaged in this repository): `npx @banur/cli epoch` or `npx @banur/cli petrichor`.

### Local development

After cloning this repository, use `lerna bootstrap` to install all dependencies for all packages. You may need to `cd` into each package and run `yarn` to install any side dependencies.

Both [`epoch`](packages/epoch) and `petrichor` are just Typescript libraries. You can run `npm link` in each of their directories to allow your local distribution (run `yarn build` before) to be locally tested & used.

The [`cli`](packages/cli) package also has support for `npm link`, but it it meant to be used in the terminal.

## Packages

This repository is a monorepo managed by [Lerna](lerna.json), and holds all the core serverware, packages and clients distributed over NPM for Banur.
